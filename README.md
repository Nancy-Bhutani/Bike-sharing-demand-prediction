# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction using Linear Regression

> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

The company wants to know:
 - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
 - How well those variables describe the bike demands.

## Goal
- Develop a model to find the variables which are significant to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.



## Conclusions
The top 3  variables that affect the bike sharing demand the most are:
 - temperature - A unit increase in temperature variable, will increase bike demand by 0.4599 values.
 - year -A unit increase in year variable, will incrrease the bikedemands by 0.2400 values.
 - windspeed - A unit increase in windspeed variable, will decrease the bike demand by 0.1694 values.
Other parameters on which the bike demands depend are - if it is a spring season, winter season, september month, july month, and moderate weather condition or not.
